# Game Dev Library

A concise collection of small, reusable TypeScript systems and components useful for game development, utilities, and prototyping. This
repository gathers lightweight implementations (and examples) for common game-engine features such as finite state machines, input
mapping, pub/sub signals, UUID generation, behavior trees, and simple components.
